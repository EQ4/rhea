Rhea documentation {#mainpage}
==================

Rhea is an incremental constraint solver based on 
[Cassowary](http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/constraints/cassowary), 
originally developed by Greg J. Badros and Alan Borning.  The main
differences are:

 * Written in modern C++11
 * Fixes some memory leaks
 * CMake instead of GNU Autoconfig
 * Unit tests use the Boost Test Framework
 * Uses Doxygen for documentation
 * Expression parser based on Boost Spirit
 * Does not have a finite domain subsolver
